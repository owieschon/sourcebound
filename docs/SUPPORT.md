# Support and lifecycle

<!-- clean-docs:policy register-v2 -->
<!-- clean-docs:purpose -->
Operators come here to adopt an existing corpus, pin the reusable gate, inspect a receipt, or build
a diagnostic bundle. It routes package lifecycle work to one install guide, so each operational
procedure has one canonical home.
<!-- clean-docs:end purpose -->

**[Check the supported environment](#supported-environments)**.

Run `clean-docs doctor` after installation; each reported check is the local readiness proof.

Install, upgrade, rollback, uninstall, and release verification live in the
[install guide](INSTALL.md).

## Supported environments

| Surface | Supported contract |
| --- | --- |
| Python runtime | CPython 3.10, 3.12, and 3.14 |
| Operating system | Current GitHub-hosted Ubuntu and macOS runners |
| Repository adapters | Static Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, package metadata, config schemas, and MCP tool discovery |
| Local workflow | CLI and pre-commit hooks |
| Pull-request workflow | Reusable GitHub Actions gate with read-only repository permission |
| Manifest | Version `1` |
| Plugin process API | Version `1` |

TypeScript and JavaScript adapters parse source without Node.js. The
[security model](SECURITY_MODEL.md) owns the boundary between static input and declared processes.

## Run the reusable pull-request gate

Pin both the reusable workflow and its package input to the same full commit:

```yaml
jobs:
  clean-docs:
    uses: owieschon/clean-docs/.github/workflows/reusable-clean-docs.yml@FULL_40_CHARACTER_CLEAN_DOCS_COMMIT
    with: {package-ref: FULL_40_CHARACTER_CLEAN_DOCS_COMMIT}
```

The workflow rejects tags, branches, abbreviated commits, and non-hexadecimal input before installation. It requests read-only repository permission. Its `clean-docs-evidence` artifact contains the raw audit, binding, and changed-surface reports plus `clean-docs-run.json`. That receipt identifies the installed clean-docs version and commit, the checked repository ref and commit, the workflow run and attempt, each result state, and the byte count and SHA-256 digest of every accompanying evidence file. Keep the artifact with a release or repair receipt when the run itself may expire.

## Adopt an existing documentation corpus

`init` is strict by default. It rolls back every bootstrap write when the current corpus has a hygiene finding. It also stops before writing when a page has no substantive authored opening that can be marked as its purpose contract. Metadata, status labels, feature fragments, and generated title boilerplate do not satisfy that boundary. A mature repository can preserve strict future checks while recording its current debt:

```bash
clean-docs init --no-model --accept-hygiene-baseline
git diff -- .clean-docs/audit-baseline.json
clean-docs audit
```

The committed baseline records each exact rule, path, line, detail, and fingerprint, including
unresolved purpose-contract findings. Adoption mode does not archive or move existing documents.
Ambiguous names such as `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` and `ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md` remain active documentation;
only unambiguous process artifacts and exact duplicates are archive candidates outside adoption
mode. Files named `*.fixture.md` are explicit test inputs rather than reader documentation. Git
tracked and non-ignored untracked Markdown files enter the corpus; Git-ignored files and hidden
configuration trees stay out. `audit` fails when a new finding appears. It also fails with
`stale-baseline` when a recorded finding is resolved, because the baseline must shrink to match
current debt.

The JSON content plan emits at most 100 representative facts and 4,000 bytes of diff per operation.
Large repositories stay reviewable. `fact_count`, `facts_omitted`, `diff_truncated`, the full-plan
digest, and the proposed `canonical_documents` preserve omitted detail without printing a
repository-sized response. `llms.txt` indexes those declared canonical documents and distinguishes
pages with bindings from declared context.

After reviewing intentional documentation repairs, replace the baseline with the current exact findings:

```bash
clean-docs audit --update-baseline
git diff -- .clean-docs/audit-baseline.json
clean-docs audit
```

Review and commit the baseline change with the documentation change. A malformed, tampered, duplicated, or symbolic-link baseline exits `2` instead of weakening the gate.

## Compatibility policy

Manifest version `1`, plugin API version `1`, and published machine-readable schemas remain compatible throughout the 1.x line. A minor release may add optional fields. It cannot change the meaning of an existing field or silently change normalized evidence for a supported adapter.

Before removal, release notes and command output announce a deprecation for at least one minor
release. Removing a stable CLI command, manifest field, evidence field, or plugin interface breaks
compatibility. It requires a major release. An incompatible manifest exits `2` and names the
required manifest change before it reads source evidence.

## Record local outcomes

`verify` runs audit, binding, and projection checks and prints `clean-docs.outcome.v1`. Add immutable refs to include pull-request impact, and write the same bytes to a local receipt with:

```bash
clean-docs verify --base origin/main --head HEAD --out .clean-docs/outcome.json
```

The receipt counts current bindings, caught drift, coverage gaps, active and baselined hygiene findings, and projection state. `bound` means a source-specific binding covers the detected locator. `cataloged` means a repository-wide inventory binding tracks the surface but no source-specific documentation claim covers it. `coverage_complete` permits either form; `direct_coverage_complete` requires source-specific bindings or reasoned ignores for the whole detected surface.

Read the receipt's `assurance` object before interpreting a green result. Its
`cataloged_surfaces_check_prose` and `judgment_prose_certified` fields remain `false`: a passing
configured contract does not certify unbound claims or prose quality. The receipt records
`network_requests: 0` and sends nothing.

Measure the changed-check P95 and peak process memory on a repository with:

```bash
clean-docs benchmark --base origin/main --head HEAD --out .clean-docs/performance.json
```

The command exits `1` when either published budget is exceeded.

## Build a diagnostic bundle

Write a support-safe JSON bundle with:

```bash
clean-docs doctor --format json --bundle .clean-docs/diagnostic.json
```

The bundle contains runtime versions, repository ref, manifest counts, plugin IDs, and doctor results. It excludes environment variables, credentials, document and source contents, and command arguments. Review the file before attaching it to a private security advisory or public support issue.

Return to the [project overview](../README.md) for the first repository setup, use the
[install guide](INSTALL.md) to move between versions, or read the
[security model](SECURITY_MODEL.md) before declaring a command or plugin.
