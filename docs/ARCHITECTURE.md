# Runtime architecture

<!-- sourcebound:policy register-v2 -->
<!-- sourcebound:purpose -->
Use this reference when choosing a Sourcebound runtime or diagnosing an MDX capability boundary. It
names the product runtime, the isolated parser adapter, and the behavior available when Node.js is
not installed.
<!-- sourcebound:end purpose -->

**[Check the installed runtime](INSTALL.md#parse-mdx-repositories)**.

## Product runtime

Sourcebound is a Python package and CLI. Python owns the manifest, source extractors, policy checks,
receipts, projections, and release artifact. Install the released wheel with a Python tool installer.

## MDX adapter

MDX has a mature syntax ecosystem in JavaScript. Sourcebound keeps that concern behind one
first-party adapter:

| Part | Owner | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools/mdx-parser/src/parser.mjs` | Authored adapter source | Parses MDX into versioned structural JSON |
| `src/clean_docs/adapters/mdx_parser.mjs` | Generated wheel input | Reproducible bundle of the pinned parser dependency graph |
| `src/clean_docs/mdx.py` | Python boundary | Starts the bundled parser with bounded input, validates its response, and exposes typed nodes |

The adapter runs in a temporary directory with a reduced environment. It parses structure only. It
does not evaluate JSX, imports, components, or repository package scripts. The [security model](SECURITY_MODEL.md#trust-tiers)
defines the process controls and their host boundary.

## Availability contract

| Repository | Node.js | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Markdown only | Absent | All supported documentation checks run normally |
| Contains MDX | Absent | MDX documents are explicitly unsupported with an actionable doctor result |
| Contains MDX | Node.js 20 or newer | The bundled parser provides structural MDX checks |

Node.js is not an npm installation requirement and Sourcebound never downloads it. CI tests the
minimum supported Node.js version and a current version against the same MDX adapter contract.
