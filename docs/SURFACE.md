# Detected repository surface

<!-- clean-docs:policy register-v2 -->
<!-- clean-docs:purpose -->
This generated catalog shows which detected source locators have direct bindings and which remain
catalog-only. Maintainers can inspect the surface behind a coverage receipt without mistaking
change visibility for a validated reader-facing claim.

**[Inspect the generated surface](#detected-repository-surface)**.

Run `clean-docs inventory --format json` to reproduce the item-level coverage state behind this
summary.

The catalog binding catches additions, removals, and replacements across the detected surface. It does not assert that every symbol or option needs a reader-facing explanation. `clean-docs verify` reports source-specific bindings as `bound` and the remaining catalog entries as `cataloged`.
