# Security model

<!-- clean-docs:policy register-v2 -->
<!-- clean-docs:purpose -->
Use this model before allowing clean-docs to run a repository command or plugin. It separates static data from declared execution, names the controls clean-docs enforces, and tells operators where the host must provide stronger isolation.
<!-- clean-docs:end purpose -->

**[Review the enforced process controls](#process-controls)**.

The [adversarial checks](#adversarial-checks) are the proof; the host boundary names what those
tests do not claim.

## Trust tiers

| Tier | Input | clean-docs behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static repository data | Source, manifests, Markdown, MDX, schemas, and package metadata | Parse without importing repository modules or evaluating source expressions |
| Declared command | One exact `argv` array named under `execution.allowed_commands` | Run without a shell in a disposable repository copy |
| Declared plugin | One exact `argv` array with API version and interfaces | Exchange versioned JSON in a disposable repository copy |
| Optional phrasing response | Recorded JSON selected by the caller | Validate against deterministic facts before any prose is accepted |

Repository text cannot turn static inventory into process execution. A command or plugin runs only after the manifest names its argument array and compatible interface.

The MDX adapter is a bundled, pinned parser running in a temporary directory with a reduced
environment. It parses the document to a source-positioned syntax tree. It does not compile or
evaluate the document, resolve ESM imports, load JSX components, or invoke repository package
scripts. Node.js is an implementation runtime for this first-party parser, not a repository-declared
process.

## Process controls

Every declared process receives a copied repository, temporary home, temporary directory, `PATH`, and `NO_COLOR`. clean-docs does not pass other environment variables. It rejects repository symlinks before execution, passes arguments directly without a shell, stops the process at its timeout or 1 MB combined input/output limit, rejects secret-like output, and discards the copy after the result is parsed.

Core code validates response schemas, computes evidence IDs and digests, rejects duplicate identities, and owns coverage state. A plugin cannot replace first-party evidence or write generated documentation directly.

## Host boundary

The process controls are not an operating-system sandbox. A declared executable can open a network connection or address an absolute host path if the surrounding runner permits it. Run untrusted declared code in a network-blocked container or equivalent OS sandbox. Keep local manifests limited to commands and plugins you would run directly.

You can still use `audit`, `inventory --no-exec`, static `init`, static bindings, projections,
recorded task scoring, and release facts when no declared process is trusted. Those paths do not
run repository code. Plain `inventory` may start an explicitly declared discoverer plugin, so use
its static flag for an untrusted revision.

Live evaluation is different: its explicit command provider is a process selected by the operator.
clean-docs records repository bytes before launch and rejects an unexpected change afterward, but
it does not sandbox the process or revoke host access. Use an execution environment that enforces
the provider's filesystem and network boundary.

For an untrusted pull request, run `inventory`, `plan`, `check`, and `verify` with `--no-exec`.
clean-docs skips manifest commands and plugins, labels the missing assurance, and fails a
changed-surface check when the pull request affects that skipped relationship. `verdict` is always
static-only. The reusable workflow runs one verdict and exposes no input that can turn trusted
execution on. It starts Python in isolated mode and writes evidence under the runner's trusted
temporary directory, not the inspected checkout. An unsafe repository symlink fails the verdict
instead of redirecting a receipt write.

## Adversarial checks

Required CI covers prompt injection, escaping symlinks, shell metacharacters, secret output, oversized output, hanging processes, extension identity collisions, and attempts to change files through relative paths. Each test asserts the exit contract and verifies that no caller-owned file changed.

Report a new bypass through the private channel in the [security policy](../SECURITY.md).
