# CLI reference

<!-- clean-docs:purpose -->
Use this reference when you know the repository task but need the clean-docs command or its write boundary. It lets you choose a command without guessing whether that command changes documentation.
<!-- clean-docs:end purpose -->

The table is generated from the command registry used by the parser:
