# CLI reference

<!-- clean-docs:policy register-v2 -->
<!-- clean-docs:purpose -->
Choose a command here after you know the repository task. The index names each write boundary, so
you can select the read or repair path without letting a preview change documentation.

**[Choose from the generated command index](#cli-reference)**.

`clean-docs <command> --help` is the proof for exact flags; every example below must pass the same
argument validator as the executable.

The table is generated from the command registry used by the parser:

## Impact plans

Use `plan` before a repair when you need to know which documentation contracts a branch can affect.
The command compares the merge base with the requested head, traverses accepted bindings,
projections, and evaluations, and writes nothing to the worktree:

```bash
clean-docs plan --base origin/main --head HEAD --format json
```

The JSON records the clean-docs producer version and every changed path with its base and head blob,
adapter decision, coverage state, and graph roots. Its digest binds that producer and those inputs
to the resulting findings. `clean-docs.impact-plan.v2` also lists
`unsupported_documents`. Structurally valid MDX uses the `mdx-static` adapter and counts as a direct
document change. Malformed MDX or a missing Node.js 20 runtime uses `mdx-static:failed`, enters the
unsupported list, and makes coverage unknown.

| `impact` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `required` | An accepted contract creates documentation work. |
| `recommended` | A known downstream task deserves review but has no gate authority. |
| `none` | Every changed artifact is classified, and the affected graph creates no documentation obligation. |
| `unknown` | A plausible public surface lacks enough adapter or relationship coverage. This is never reported as no impact. |

A valid plan exits zero even when `impact` is `required` or `unknown`; the exit code says the receipt
was built, not that the branch is documentation-complete. Use `check --changed` for the existing
blocking gate. A projection output is evidence of prior work, so changing only that generated file
does not recursively make it an impact root.

## Pull-request verdicts

Use `verdict` when a pull-request runner or agent needs one decision instead of interpreting audit,
binding, projection, and changed-surface outputs independently:

```bash
clean-docs verdict \
  --base origin/main \
  --head HEAD \
  --format json > clean-docs-verdict.json
```

The caller worktree must be clean, and `--head` must resolve to the checked-out commit. The command
uses static first-party adapters only. It does not run repository commands or plugins, write cache
entries, or change the worktree.

`clean-docs.pr-verdict.v1` is the canonical agent integration receipt. It includes:

- producer version, requested base, merge base, and head commit;
- manifest and impact-plan digests;
- audit and accepted-baseline state;
- separate region, command-pin, symbol, plugin, source-claim, and projection counts;
- changed files, required work, gaps, ignores, unsupported documents, and impact state;
- inventory totals split into direct bindings, catalog-only records, ignores, and unknowns;
- every skipped binding, command, and plugin ID;
- stable findings with a repair action; and
- explicit non-claims for unbound prose, judgment prose, mutation semantics, and catalog prose.

| `state` | Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ready` | `0` | The branch passes within `configured-contract-and-changed-surface`. Read coverage, skips, and non-claims before reusing the result. |
| `not_ready` | `1` | Deterministic drift or an enforced integrity defect blocks the branch. |
| `unknown` | `1` | A plausible obligation lacks supported evidence, or affected declared execution was skipped. |
| `invalid` | `2` or `3` | A ref, caller state, manifest, or supplied receipt failed validation (`2`), or static extraction failed (`3`). |

`--format sarif` reports the same finding IDs and verdict digest as JSON. A valid verdict with no
findings still emits a complete JSON receipt; SARIF remains an annotation projection of that
receipt.

Repeat `--mutation-receipt PATH` to summarize a
`clean-docs.binding-sensitivity.v1` receipt. clean-docs checks its commit and mutation-plan digest
before including its byte digest and state. The receipt cannot change the verdict and must keep
`semantic_relationship_authorized` false. A `sensitive` result only shows that the check went stale
after the frozen fact changed. It does not let clean-docs accept the relationship.

## Static-only pull-request checks

Add `--no-exec` to `inventory`, `plan`, `check`, or `verify` when the repository revision is
untrusted. Static first-party extractors continue to run. Static inventory lists skipped discoverer
plugin IDs. The other commands report each skipped command pin or plugin result as
`skipped-untrusted-execution` and do not start that process.

An unscoped `check --no-exec` can pass its static findings while returning `complete: false`.
`check --changed --no-exec` fails when the pull request affects a skipped relationship because its
state is unknown. `verdict` is unconditionally static-only; the reusable pull-request workflow uses
that one receipt as its result and exposes no execution switch. Run trusted command and plugin
checks in a separately configured default-branch or scheduled job.

Run `clean-docs <command> --help` for command-specific flags. Return to the [project overview](../README.md) for installation and the supported binding surface.
