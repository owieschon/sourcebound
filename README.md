# clean-docs

<!-- clean-docs:policy register-v2 -->
<!-- clean-docs:purpose -->
clean-docs is a source-bound documentation engine and CLI for maintainers who need code and prose to change together. It turns selected source facts into checked documentation, so stale claims fail in local workflows and CI.
<!-- clean-docs:end purpose -->

[![CI](https://github.com/owieschon/clean-docs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/owieschon/clean-docs/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/owieschon/clean-docs?display_name=tag&sort=semver)](https://github.com/owieschon/clean-docs/releases/latest) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-25225f.svg)](LICENSE)

**[Install the stable release and catch your first stale claim](docs/learn/tutorial-catch-a-lying-doc.md)**.

The final `clean-docs verify` command prints a [`clean-docs.outcome.v2` receipt](docs/SUPPORT.md#record-local-outcomes) with `"ok": true`.

Before adoption, `audit` reports bounded repository-neutral advisories. A manifest turns integrity checks into gates; policy markers opt compatible writing rules into specific documents. Neither authorizes clean-docs to flatten repository-native forms.

## Why clean-docs exists

<!-- clean-docs:begin product-overview -->
A stale sentence does not fail loudly. It keeps a straight face after the code has moved on, and reviewers have no mechanical way to identify the false claim. clean-docs gives each protected fact a source, then checks that relationship again in CI.

Declared sources own the protected facts. A packaged policy enforces the deterministic form floor; authored judgment still owns motivation, pedagogy, and voice. Static adapters read common code and schema formats, while declared commands run under explicit process controls. The engine can repair bound regions, rank static count and column candidates, enforce accepted source-claim relationships, and publish context such as `llms.txt` with local receipts.
<!-- clean-docs:end product-overview -->

Human review can improve a sentence. It cannot make the sentence fail when its defining source changes. The [deterministic seam](docs/learn/deep-dive-the-deterministic-seam.md) explains how clean-docs separates source evidence, optional phrasing, and gate authority.

## Install in the repository you want to protect

From that repository, download the latest stable wheel, install it in an isolated environment, and run the manifest-free audit:

```bash
release_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
gh release download --repo owieschon/clean-docs \
  --pattern 'clean_docs-*-py3-none-any.whl' --dir "$release_dir"
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install "$release_dir"/clean_docs-*.whl
clean-docs audit
```

After reviewing the assessment, inspect the files that `init` proposes before accepting its gate:

```bash
clean-docs init --no-model
git diff -- .clean-docs.yml .clean-docs/repository-surface.md README.md llms.txt
clean-docs check
clean-docs verify
```

An established, unregistered README stays byte-for-byte authored. Init writes its detected catalog to `.clean-docs/repository-surface.md`; a new README or one that adopted the register may own that region directly.

After a bound source changes, run `check`, then use `drive` for a declared repair. Run `project` when a declared projection depends on the repaired document, then run `verify`. The [tutorial](docs/learn/tutorial-catch-a-lying-doc.md) shows the failure before the repair; the [support guide](docs/SUPPORT.md) covers mature-repository adoption.

## How the pieces fit

Three inputs stay separate before the deterministic core:

- **Authored intent** records why a surface matters. clean-docs preserves that purpose; it does not infer its priority or turn judgment into gate authority.
- **Repository contract** declares sources, binding mechanisms, process limits, and projections. Policy markers scope compatible form checks; they do not certify voice.
- **Change state** combines base and head refs with that contract to produce an immutable impact plan. Static adapters and bounded commands produce typed evidence. Each mechanism proves only its declared relationship; accepted source-claim checks are separate, and unbound prose stays visibly unknown.

The core exposes four job-specific exits:

1. **Repair bounded prose.** `drive` writes only planned regions. `project` runs separately when a declared output depends on changed documentation.
2. **Reject stale changes.** `check` and `verdict` are read-only. The verdict names changed, bound, unbound, and skipped surfaces.
3. **Publish agent context.** `project` writes declared outputs such as `llms.txt` and context bundles.
4. **Record local state.** `verify` emits its own outcome receipt.

`verdict` and `verify` produce independent receipts. Neither certifies unbound or judgment prose. The [product contract](CLEAN_DOCS_SPEC.md) defines each authority boundary.

## Current boundaries

- Catalog coverage detects source additions, removals, and replacements; it does not validate prose.
- Source-claim discovery ranks static count and identifier-set candidates. A candidate remains advisory until the repository accepts its exact document and source relationship.
- Declared processes use time, I/O, and environment controls. The host owns network isolation; see the [security model](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md).
- The manifest decides what clean-docs evaluates. Authored purpose records goals; clean-docs does not infer or certify them.
- Feedback is off by default. Enabled runs queue bounded local envelopes; only an explicit `feedback flush` contacts the configured sink, and delivery cannot change a gate result.

Use the [learning path](docs/learn/index.md) for examples. The [product contract](CLEAN_DOCS_SPEC.md) owns parser, write-boundary, and exit-code details.
