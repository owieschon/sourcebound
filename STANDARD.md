# Documentation style guide: clean, grounded developer docs

<!-- clean-docs:purpose -->
STANDARD.md is the canonical writing and documentation policy packaged with clean-docs. Use it when writing or reviewing repository documentation for people or agents: it prevents correct facts from becoming hard to find, easy to misread, or detached from source, and it defines how to choose the right medium, voice, canonical home, and evidence boundary for each claim.
<!-- clean-docs:end purpose -->

<!-- clean-docs:allow doc-length reason="The four documentation tiers form one canonical standard and must be evaluated together" -->
<!-- clean-docs:allow audience reason="This standard names agent-workflow signals as policy examples rather than addressing an agent" -->

Derived from a close reading of a developer-documentation corpus spanning overview,
quickstart, workflows, best practices, memory, hooks, integrations, settings, and CLI
reference pages. Every rule below traces to an observed, repeated convention in that corpus.
clean-docs packages this file as its canonical default standard.

## The one principle everything else follows

**Choose the medium by what the reader is doing at that sentence, not by what the content is about.**

| Reader's current verb | Medium |
| --- | --- |
| Orienting, deciding, or asking why | Prose |
| Doing something in code or a shell | Runnable code block |
| Acting in a visual interface | Cropped screenshot or short video |
| Choosing among options or comparing attributes | Table |
| Looking up one fact by key | Registry or generated reference |
| Following a sequence | Numbered steps |
| Understanding flow, state, or relationships | Diagram plus text equivalent |
| Avoiding a non-obvious trap | Semantic callout |
| Doing the same task in one of several environments | Deep-linkable tabs |
| Checking whether the task worked | Expected result or verification command |

A page is just this rule applied sentence by sentence. Reference pages look different from
tutorials only because a reference reader looks-up more often than a tutorial reader orients.

---

## 1. The medium boundary (the decisions to get right)

### Prose: carries the "why" and any logic spanning multiple items
Prose is for cause and effect: anything with a *because* in it. It always comes *before*
code, never after as cleanup. Precedence rules, tradeoffs, and mechanism are prose (or a
numbered list), never a table, because they're an *ordering*, not a *lookup*.

> "An agent stops when the work looks done. Without a check it can run, 'looks done' is the
> only signal available, and you become the verification loop: every mistake waits for you
> to notice it."

Three sentences of pure mechanism before any command is named. That's the job of prose.

### Code: executable evidence, never bare
Code can teach the action directly once the reader knows why they are taking it. Two hard rules:
- **No bare block.** Every code block has a prose lead-in ending in a colon that says what
  it does, and often a follow-up naming what to notice or what breaks.
- **Comments are sparse.** Use one only when the code cannot express a constraint or intent.
  Do not make comments narrate the example line by line.

When placement matters, name the file. Use realistic names and values that expose the shape of the
task. Use tabs for language or platform variants, visual diffs for a progressive edit, focus or
collapse markers for the lines that matter, and a copy action for install commands. A reader must be
able to tell whether a block is runnable, configuration, output, or a prompt before copying it.

The escalation ladder inside a single block is a signature move. It goes abstract form, then a
real named instance, then the complication:
```bash
# Basic syntax
docs-tool integration add --transport http <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Notion
docs-tool integration add --transport http notes https://api.example.com/integration

# Example with Bearer token
docs-tool integration add --transport http secure-api https://api.example.com/integration \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```
Placeholders (`<name>`, `YOUR_TOKEN`, `/path/to/x`) and real recognizable values (Notion,
Stripe) are **never mixed on one line**. The language tag sets the reader's action: `bash` = run in a
shell, `json`/`yaml` = config, `text` = type this *to* the agent (a prompt). Keep that split.

### Table: for comparison or lookup, where order doesn't matter
Tables compare several items across several attributes, index facts by key, define terms in context,
or show before-and-after states. Column design mirrors the questions the reader is asking:
`Scope | Loads in | Shared with team | Stored in`. Cell rule: **left column is a bare token
in code font; right columns are sentences that scale with complexity.** A simple flag gets a
fragment; a hard one gets a paragraph *in the same cell* until it earns its own section. The
"do this / not that" two-column ✅/❌ table is the canonical way to show a rule at scale.

### Callout: an off-ramp, never where a concept is first taught
Callout type is semantic, not decorative:
- **Warning** = this will hurt you (data, security, a silent violation of what you expect).
  Name the wrong assumption explicitly: "…even though 1 is the conventional Unix failure code."
- **Note** = a true-but-easily-missed clarification or a scope boundary.
- **Tip** = optional power-user extra, often a `Tips:` bullet list.

### Diagrams: make relationships and state visible
Use a diagram for data flow, lifecycle, architecture, or decision branching when prose would force
the reader to reconstruct the shape. It may be the primary explanation. Follow it with a text
description that preserves the meaning for screen readers, search, and text-only tools.

### Screenshots and video: teach recognition and interaction
Use a screenshot when the reader must find, distinguish, or verify something visual. Crop unrelated
UI, use a consistent viewport, annotate the target, remove personal or sensitive data, write useful
alt text, and provide light and dark variants when appearance changes. A caption states what to
notice rather than repeating the image.

Video is optional. Use it only when motion is necessary to understand a multi-step interaction or
temporal UI behavior and the team can maintain it. Prefer a controllable video to an animated image.
Provide a complete text path to the same outcome and make code legible at full screen. A person or
agent must be able to complete and verify every documented task without watching it. Do not use media
as decoration or as the only record of a fact.

---

## 2. Voice at the sentence level

- **Second person + imperative for the reader's actions.** "Open your terminal." "Set to
  `true` to disable." Not "one can" or "users should."
- **Name the system as an actor** so behavior reads as fact, not promise: "The tool skips
  that server and reports the error." Behavior is stated, not sold, which is why the docs
  never read as marketing.
- **Every clause adds information.** Split a sentence when its claims need separate evidence or
  differ in scope. Keep tightly coupled cause and effect together.
- **Plain, concrete verbs.** Things fill, skip, block, load, collide. Never "leverage", "utilize", "seamlessly", "powerful", "simply", or "comprehensive". <!-- slop-ok: naming banned booster words as negative examples -->
- **State facts without hedging.** "The tool always asks for permission before modifying
  files" is absolute, not "usually." When advice is *genuinely* situational, mark the
  uncertainty explicitly ("Sometimes you *should* let context accumulate…") rather than blur it.
- **Contractions are fine** ("you'll", "won't", "let's"); the register is a helpful senior
  colleague, not a spec.
- **Use present tense and active voice.** Use future tense only for behavior that has not happened.
  Passive voice is useful only when the actor is unknown or irrelevant.
- **Remove trivializers.** Words such as "easy", "obvious", and "just" dismiss the reader's
  difficulty. State the action and its prerequisites instead. <!-- slop-ok -->
- **Use sentence case for headings, American English, and the Oxford comma.** Spell out zero through
  nine; use numerals from 10 onward and for percentages or technical values.
- **Format interface paths consistently.** Bold control labels and write nested paths as
  **Parent > Child > Control**. Reserve bold for semantic labels, definitions, and UI controls,
  not general emphasis.
- **Link the first meaningful mention.** Use descriptive link text, point to the exact destination,
  and deep-link into the product when the reader's next action happens there. Never use "click here".

### Whimsy: give precision a pulse

Precise does not mean bloodless. Dry wit, a physical metaphor, or a lightly playful example can
make a mechanism easier to remember. That personality is part of the teaching, not frosting spread
across the page.

- **Personality has a budget.** Overview, conceptual, and tutorial pages get at least one
  subject-derived memorable element unless the entire topic sits in a literal zone. Spend at most
  one flourish in a conceptual section. A page does not owe the reader a joke.
- **Earn the whimsy from the mechanism.** A metaphor must preserve how the system works. "The cache
  has not developed opinions; two configuration layers disagree" earns its dry aside by naming the
  real failure immediately. A generic quip teaches nothing.
- **Give examples a small, coherent world.** Prefer plausible names with a little character, such as
  Acorn Bakery or Moonbase Support, over `foo`, `test123`, and a different joke in every block. Keep
  runnable commands and security-sensitive values literal.
- **Keep the searchable noun in playful headings.** "Retries: when the queue refuses to take a
  hint" is findable. "Here we go again" is not.
- **Let visuals carry character only when the motif explains the system.** A tether can represent a
  source binding; a decorative mascot cannot. Preserve high contrast, useful alt text, and a complete
  text equivalent.

Commands, configuration, error messages, repair steps, security and privacy boundaries,
accessibility text, and API or option reference are literal zones. Do not put wit between a reader
and an exact action, failure, or fact. Never use sarcasm at the reader, stacked puns, meme or
pop-culture references, emoji decoration, or anthropomorphism that invents agency.

Run two judgment checks. The **truth test** asks whether the source or mechanism supports the
metaphor. The **deletion test** removes the flourish and confirms that the technical claim, warning,
and next action remain complete. If either test fails, cut it.

---

## 3. How to explain something technical simply (the actual techniques)

The bar: a competent reader who has never seen this system grasps what it is and does from the
first screen. Concretely, the first sentence is a plain definition ("X is a Y that does A, B, C"),
every abstraction is grounded on first use or cut, and each sentence carries one claim. The
measure is a blind read: hand the doc to a reader with no prior context and check whether they can
state back what the system is. The docs hit that bar with specific, repeatable moves:

### Define the subject, then state the BLUF purpose contract

Definition and purpose are separate reader contracts. An ontological definition names what category
the subject belongs to: "X is a Y." A purpose contract states who should continue, what problem the
page addresses, and what the reader can do afterward. A capability list or value proposition can
answer what a system does while leaving its category ambiguous, so neither substitutes for a
definition.

Every product, system, or concept overview opens with a plain category definition before explaining
value or mechanism. Name the narrowest category the sources support, then add the distinguishing
boundary a reader needs. "QueueKit is a Python task queue that stores jobs in PostgreSQL" defines a
category and boundary. "QueueKit processes jobs quickly" states behavior but never says what it is.
Procedural pages whose subject is already established link to its canonical definition and open with
the purpose contract instead of repeating it.

Every doc opens with the documentation equivalent of a function contract. State the bottom line
before the explanation so the wrong reader can leave and the right reader knows what the page will
change for them.

| Contract slot | The opener answers |
| --- | --- |
| Precondition | Who this is for and when it applies |
| Job | What problem leaves the reader stuck without this page |
| Postcondition | What the reader can do after reading |

Keep the contract falsifiable and true to the code. A title restatement adds no contract. A feature
list describes the implementation instead of the reader's problem. Booster prose cannot be checked.
A scope claim the page or product does not deliver is documentation drift.

The deterministic floor checks that one purpose block exists, appears before any body content, and
does not restate the H1. Judgment checks whether an overview names a true category and whether the
purpose contract names a real audience, problem, and resulting capability without overselling the
implementation. Category truth cannot be inferred from sentence shape: "X is a platform" passes a
regex and can still be false. A mechanical pass never substitutes for that truth check.

### Use repeatable explanation techniques

1. **Open with a definition, then the one constraint that explains everything downstream.**
   Best-practices names it once ("The context window fills up fast, and performance
   degrades as it fills") and refers back to it for the rest of the page. Find your page's
   single governing constraint and name it early.
2. **Restate the mechanism as a plain cause-and-effect chain with the reader as the actor,
   *then* show code.** "When an event fires and a matcher matches, the tool passes JSON to
   your hook handler… Your handler can then inspect the input, take action, and return a decision."
3. **Hand over a testable heuristic instead of an abstract rule.** "For each line, ask: 'Would
   removing this cause the agent to make mistakes?' If not, cut it." A question the reader can run
   beats a principle they have to interpret.
4. **Teach terms in use, not in a glossary.** New terms ("matcher", "scope") first appear
   inside a working sentence that makes their meaning obvious from context.
5. **Ground the abstract in a physical metaphor.** "Before they touch disk", "so the edits
   don't collide", "keep your context clean."
6. **Lead a conceptual section with a one-line takeaway, then earn it** in the prose that follows.

---

## 4. "Don't do this" and gotchas

- **Every "don't" ships with its "instead."** "'Use 2-space indentation' instead of 'Format
  code properly.'" Never state a prohibition alone.
- **A warning states the failure's *mechanism*, not just its existence.** The reader is
  trusted to generalize. "JSON output is only processed on exit 0. If you exit 2, any JSON is
  ignored."
- **Tier by severity:** reasoned platform gotchas stay inline mid-paragraph; the non-obvious
  thing that silently bites goes in a `Warning`; recurring behavioral mistakes get *named* and
  collected ("The kitchen sink session", "The over-specified agent instructions") with a `Fix:` under each.

---

## 5. Page shape by genre

<!-- clean-docs:allow section-length reason="The genre contracts form one comparison set and splitting them would hide their boundaries" -->

**Overview** (decide): plain definition and value → supported environments and essential capabilities
→ visual model where useful → routes to setup, concepts, and common jobs. It answers what this is,
whether it fits the reader's stack, and where to start.

**Getting started** (first outcome): prerequisites shared before any platform branches → minimal
installation → one useful result → explicit verification → next task. Exclude advanced configuration.

**Start here** (adoption syllabus): visible milestones → required, recommended, and optional work →
the goal of each milestone → links to the focused procedure → next useful outcome. Progress markers
reduce abandonment; they are not decoration.

**Tutorial** (linear learning): payoff and prerequisites → imperative step spine → each step combines
only the media needed to act → observable result → next experiment or related guide. State a time cost
only when it is grounded.

**Conceptual** (mental model): definition → the constraint or problem it explains → relationships,
data flow, or terms → consequences for the reader. Use diagrams for shape and tables for definitions.
Do not force an instruction into a concept page.

**Guide** (one job): outcome-shaped title → brief applicability and prerequisites → practical steps →
verification → next related job. Name the job the reader is doing, not the feature they happen to use.

**Troubleshooting** (recover): searchable symptom → likely cause → diagnostic → repair → expected
result → escalation. When several causes are possible, expose the decision path. Put setup off-ramps
first and escalation last.

**Reference** (lookup): one-line descriptor → minimal context for precedence or scope → generated or
structured entries → examples where they resolve ambiguity. Order by the reader's journey unless it
is a pure alphabetic registry. Generate signatures, parameters, schemas, and defaults from the source
that defines them; hand-write only the context needed to use them correctly.

**Safety, privacy, or cost controls** (choose a boundary): state what is protected, where the control
executes, and what remains outside it → order options from least to most restrictive → name defaults,
inheritance, and overrides → show how to verify the boundary.

**Universal:** teach through **orient → act → observe → verify → extend**, omitting verbs the genre
does not need. Order sections by the reader's journey, not the alphabet except in a pure registry.
Link outward rather than expanding a second job inline. Keep version notes beside the claim they
modify; never add a changelog section to current reference.

---

## 6. Beyond the single doc: does it earn its existence?

The rules above make one doc good. These decide whether a doc should exist, how long it may
be, and whether its content already lives elsewhere. This is the level most prose fails at: a
corpus of individually-clean docs still sprawls. Each rule below is a check a reviewer can run.

- **Published surface ≠ process log.** A per-run report, handoff, dispatch ledger, status
  update, or blocked-note is build exhaust; it belongs in git history, a PR, or an issue,
  never as a committed reader-facing doc. Enforce it by location (gitignore / an `archive/`
  outside the doc tree), not by willpower. Test: if a doc's second person is "the next
  executor" and its body is worktree state, branch ownership, or task accounting, it fails.
- **Every published doc's audience is a reader, not a future agent.** If it reads as
  agent-to-agent pickup, it is not documentation; cut it from the surface.
- **One canonical home per fact.** A fact shared by a family of docs lives in exactly one doc;
  siblings cite it and state only their own deviations. (Same invariant as the second brain:
  link, never copy.) N sibling pages each re-deriving one shared spec is the tell.
- **Reference states current truth; provenance goes in a changelog.** Verification receipts,
  deltas from a prior baseline, and `(Program N)` / `(Wave N)` tags do not belong inside a
  reference doc. Test: if a passage would be equally true with its history deleted, delete the
  history.
- **No sentence restates a prior one in different words.** This is the highest-yield concision
  check. The per-sentence "does this add information" test is blind to redundancy at paragraph
  scale; this one catches it.
- **Each section leads with its takeaway in one sentence, then supports it or is cut.** A
  section whose takeaway is "see the table" means the prose should *be* the table.
- **Length forces a justification.** A section over ~40 lines splits or states in its first
  line why it stays whole; a doc over ~120 lines justifies being one file. Name the doc's one
  job in its first line; content serving a second job links out. This is the only check that
  bites a 300-line dossier of individually-tight sentences.
- **Prefer the denser medium.** An inline 3-to-7-item enumeration (vendor classes, data
  sources, tested dimensions) is a table or list, not a sentence.

### Give the corpus a navigation contract

Readers should be able to predict where a fact lives. Use a stable taxonomy such as overview,
getting started, concepts, guides, troubleshooting, and reference. A product area does not need every
category, but a label must keep the same reader intent everywhere it appears. Navigation names the
reader's destination, not the repository's internal architecture.

Treat each path as a contract:

| Path | Reader question |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | What is this, does it fit, and where do I begin? |
| Getting started | What is the shortest verified path to a useful result? |
| Concepts | Why does the system behave this way? |
| Guides | How do I complete this job? |
| Troubleshooting | How do I recover from this symptom? |
| Reference | What is the exact current value, shape, or behavior? |

### Keep facts next to the behavior that owns them

Place a fact's canonical source as close as practical to the code, schema, configuration, or product
surface that defines it. Render other surfaces from that source. A web guide, in-product onboarding,
command help, and an agent projection may differ in presentation, but they must not independently
restate shared facts.

Generated reference and hand-written explanation are complements. Generate signatures, options,
defaults, and schemas. Hand-write motivation, mental models, examples, failure modes, and the links
between tasks. When generation cannot prove a prose claim, label that boundary instead of implying
that inventory coverage validates the prose.

### Enforce rules at the narrowest honest layer

Layer checks by scope and severity. Corpus rules inspect ownership and duplication. Page rules inspect
structure and links. Sentence rules inspect terms, voice, and mechanics. Errors block demonstrably
wrong or unsafe output; warnings flag likely defects; suggestions expose judgment calls.

Every deterministic rule needs a positive fixture, a negative fixture, and a documented repair.
Classify exceptions by kind, such as proper names, case-sensitive technology terms, or accepted
jargon. Do not hide unrelated failures behind a blanket suppression. Use a model or human to judge
truth, usefulness, and pedagogy, not to rediscover punctuation that a linter can identify exactly.

### Assign ownership and learn from failed tasks

The owner closest to a fact writes or approves its current truth. The documentation-system owner
maintains structure, tooling, navigation, and the reading experience. Every published area names an
owner so stale pages have a destination.

Prioritize changes from observed reader failures: repeated support questions, failed setup attempts,
unhelpful-page feedback, missing search results, and tasks an agent cannot complete from published
material. Record the evidence outside the reader-facing page. Repair the canonical source, regenerate
its projections, and rerun the failed task.

### What only judgment can check (the honest seam)

The deterministic linter (`doc-hygiene.py`) sees names, lengths, token overlap, and
vocabulary. Three corpus rules resist mechanization, so a reviewer or an eventual LLM-judge
pass owns them. Each is stated so a human can run it today; none is faked into a brittle
regex, because a judge-by-pattern check for a judgment call misfires in both directions.

- **An executed or superseded plan is process exhaust; a live plan is a reference.** The
  filename does not separate them: `EVAL_PLAN.md` is an active landing page, while a
  `RESEED_PLAN.md` whose first line reads "EXECUTED by Program 9" is history. Read the status
  line, not the name. Instead of a filename rule, an LLM-judge reads the opening lines and asks
  whether the plan's work is finished.
- **A doc about agent operation is not a doc written for a future agent.** An agent profile
  legitimately says "worktree" and "DoD table" because that is its subject; the
  vocabulary-density check flags it anyway. Instead of raising the threshold, judge the second
  person: is the reader a human learning the system, or the next executor picking up a branch.
- **Each section leads with its takeaway.** A section whose first sentence is "see the table"
  buries its point, and no token pattern detects a missing lead. Instead of a mechanical check,
  an LLM-judge scoring the first sentence of each section is where this one slots in.

**A rule enforced mechanically is a floor, not a finish.** This document's own no-em-dash rule,
applied by find-replace, once turned every em dash into a double hyphen: rule-compliant, and a
typewriter-ism in the one file that cannot afford one. The repair was to rephrase each sentence
by hand, choosing a colon, a period, or a restructure by what the sentence was doing, because
only judgment knows which. That is the same seam as the sentence gate and the three rules above:
a checker enforces the letter of a rule, but whether the result reads well is the judgment it
cannot make. Read every mechanical pass as the floor you start from, never the standard you ship.

---

## 7. Grounding: the doc must be true to the code (and stay true)

A doc can be perfectly voiced, well structured, and accessible and still be wrong, because the
code moved and the prose did not. The other tiers check how a doc reads; grounding checks whether
it matches the system. It is the truth tier.

- **Derive the factual spine from source; do not paraphrase it.** Capability lists, CLI flags,
  config options, routes, counts, and version facts each have a source of truth in the code (a
  registry, a signature, a test). Render them from that source. A human paraphrasing an old draft
  is how a doc goes stale.
- **A factual defect is fixed at the code, not in a better sentence.** When a doc misstates what
  the system does, re-derive the claim from the code. Editing the prose is the wrong altitude.
- **Verify a claim against its source, never against a commit message or narrative.** "24 of 24
  tests pass" is checked by running the tests. A changelog entry comes from the code delta, not
  from what a commit said it did.
- **Bind a factual claim to its source so drift is detectable:** a generated region re-renders and
  diffs, a claim assertion re-runs, a cited symbol is checked to still exist.
- **State the honest boundary.** Grounding makes the derivable spine drift-proof. It does not make
  the judgment prose (the why, the framing, the positioning) drift-proof; that stays a human or
  advisory-review concern, never a silent gate. Claim "the documented spine cannot silently
  drift," never "the doc can never be stale."

This tier is the newest, added after a real doc described a nine-action system as one that "drafts
customer emails." No amount of voice or structure work catches that; only grounding does.

## 8. Pre-publish checklist

<!-- clean-docs:allow section-length reason="The checklist is the executable review surface for every tier of this standard" -->

Run this against any doc before shipping. Each line is a fail/pass check.

- [ ] Every code block has a prose lead-in ending in `:` and (where useful) a follow-up.
- [ ] No table encodes precedence or an ordering rule; those are prose or numbered lists.
- [ ] Every comparison table's columns are the reader's actual questions; ordered logic stays
      in prose or numbered steps.
- [ ] Every "don't" is paired with an "instead"; every warning states a *mechanism*.
- [ ] Callouts are semantic (Warning = harm, Note = easily-missed, Tip = optional) and none
      carries a concept's first explanation.
- [ ] Placeholders and real values are never mixed on one line; language tags are correct
      (`bash` vs `text` vs `json`).
- [ ] Code examples are realistic and sparse in comments; filenames, diffs, focus, or tabs expose
      placement and variants when needed.
- [ ] Screenshots are cropped, scrubbed, annotated, captioned, and described; optional video has a
      complete text path; diagrams have a text equivalent.
- [ ] The page names its one governing constraint early.
- [ ] No booster adjectives (`seamless`, `powerful`, `simply`, `comprehensive`, `leverage`, `utilize`). <!-- slop-ok: banned-word registry for the checklist -->
- [ ] Every clause adds information; claims needing separate evidence are split; the system is named
      as an actor; reader actions are imperative.
- [ ] Every overview, conceptual, or tutorial page has at least one subject-derived memorable element
      unless its topic is wholly literal; each flourish passes the truth and deletion tests.
- [ ] Commands, configuration, errors, repair steps, security and privacy boundaries, accessibility
      text, and reference facts stay literal; whimsy never carries a required fact or action.
- [ ] Headings use sentence case; UI controls use semantic bold; link text names its destination.
- [ ] Sections end by linking outward; version notes are inline at the claim.
- [ ] No process artifact (report, handoff, dispatch, status, blocked-note) is on the
      reader-facing doc surface; that content lives in git, PRs, or issues.
- [ ] Every published doc's audience is a reader, not a future agent.
- [ ] No fact is restated across sibling docs; shared facts have one canonical home, cited.
- [ ] The page fits the corpus navigation contract and its genre follows the reader's intended path.
- [ ] Procedures include an observable result and verification; troubleshooting proceeds from
      symptom through diagnosis and repair before escalation.
- [ ] Generated reference comes from the defining source; hand-written prose supplies context rather
      than copying signatures, schemas, defaults, or option lists.
- [ ] Every deterministic rule has positive and negative fixtures, a repair, a severity, and a scoped
      exception model.
- [ ] No reference doc carries provenance, receipts, or baseline deltas; those go in a changelog.
- [ ] No sentence restates a prior sentence; each section leads with its takeaway.
- [ ] Each doc names its one job in its first line; docs >120 lines and sections >40 lines
      justify staying whole or split.
- [ ] Every factual claim (capabilities, flags, counts, routes) traces to a source in the code,
      not to memory or an old draft.
- [ ] For every product, system, or concept overview, the first screen defines what category the
      subject belongs to with an ontological definition, not merely what it does; a reader with no
      context could state it back.
- [ ] The first body block is a BLUF purpose contract: applicability, problem, and resulting
      capability are explicit, falsifiable, and true to the code.
