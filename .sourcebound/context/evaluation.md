# Sourcebound

<!-- sourcebound:policy register-v2 -->
<!-- sourcebound:purpose -->
Sourcebound is a documentation engine and CLI for maintainers who need code and prose to change together. It binds selected claims to their defining sources, so drifted documentation fails locally and in CI instead of reaching readers.
<!-- sourcebound:end purpose -->

[![CI](https://github.com/owieschon/sourcebound/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/owieschon/sourcebound/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/owieschon/sourcebound?display_name=tag&sort=semver)](https://github.com/owieschon/sourcebound/releases/latest) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-25225f.svg)](LICENSE)

**[Install the stable release and catch your first stale claim](docs/learn/tutorial-catch-a-lying-doc.md)**.

The final `sourcebound verify` command prints a [`sourcebound.outcome.v2` receipt](docs/SUPPORT.md#record-local-outcomes) with `"ok": true`.

Before adoption, `audit` reports bounded repository-neutral advisories. A manifest turns integrity checks into gates; policy markers opt compatible writing rules into specific documents. Neither authorizes Sourcebound to flatten repository-native forms.

## Why Sourcebound exists

<!-- sourcebound:begin product-overview -->
A stale sentence does not fail loudly. It keeps a straight face after the code has moved on, and reviewers have no mechanical way to identify the false claim. Sourcebound gives each protected fact a source, then checks that relationship again in CI.

Declared sources own the protected facts. A packaged policy enforces the deterministic form floor; authored judgment still owns motivation, pedagogy, and voice. Static adapters read common code and schema formats, while declared commands run under explicit process controls. The engine can repair bound regions, rank static count and column candidates, enforce accepted source-claim relationships, and project canonical text and visual records into purpose-built human and agent surfaces with local receipts.
<!-- sourcebound:end product-overview -->

Human review can improve a sentence. It cannot make the sentence fail when its defining source changes. The [deterministic seam](docs/learn/deep-dive-the-deterministic-seam.md) explains how Sourcebound separates source evidence, optional phrasing, and gate authority.

## Use Sourcebound when

Use Sourcebound when an authored explanation contains a selected fact with a stable owner in code, configuration, a schema, or a registry. For example, a public action table can derive from `ACTIONS` in `src/actions.py`; a source-only rename makes `check` fail, and `drive` updates only the declared table region. The [tutorial](docs/learn/tutorial-catch-a-lying-doc.md) runs that exact loop.

Use another tool when it owns the job better. Vale can own prose mechanics. Doc Detective can own whether a consequential procedure still works. A generator can own an entire API or schema reference. If those tools already cover the facts you need, Sourcebound may not justify another gate. The [ecosystem guide](docs/ECOSYSTEM.md) names the boundary.

## Install in the repository you want to protect

Install the stable CLI in an isolated environment, then run the manifest-free audit from the
repository you want to protect:

```bash
pipx install sourcebound
sourcebound audit
```

Use `uv tool install sourcebound` instead when `uv` owns your command-line tools. The
[installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md) covers offline wheelhouses, upgrades, and rollback. The
[release verification guide](docs/VERIFY_RELEASE.md) checks published bytes and provenance.

After reviewing the assessment, inspect the files that `init` proposes before accepting its gate:

```bash
sourcebound init --no-model
git diff -- .sourcebound.yml .sourcebound/repository-surface.md README.md llms.txt
sourcebound check
sourcebound verify
```

An established, unregistered README stays byte-for-byte authored. Init writes its detected catalog to `.sourcebound/repository-surface.md`; a new README or one that adopted the register may own that region directly. Its plan also reports zero directly protected prose after catalog-only setup and lists bounded advisory source-claim candidates when static ownership evidence supports them. Review a candidate, then add its exact relationship manually or reject it.

After a bound source changes, run `check`, then use `drive` for a declared repair. Run `project` when a declared projection depends on the repaired document, then run `verify`. The [tutorial](docs/learn/tutorial-catch-a-lying-doc.md) shows the failure before the repair; the [support guide](docs/SUPPORT.md) covers mature-repository adoption.

## How the pieces fit

`authored intent + repository contract + change state → typed evidence → bounded check, repair, projection, and receipt`

**Authored intent** states what the maintainers want readers to know. Sourcebound does not infer its priority, completeness, or editorial quality. **Repository contract** selects the facts and relationships that earn deterministic treatment. Each mechanism proves only its declared relationship: accepted source-claim checks are separate from generated regions, and unbound prose stays visibly unknown.

An immutable impact plan fixes the changed scope before a check reports on it. This gives the repository four job-specific exits: `drive` writes only planned regions; `check` and `verdict` are read-only; `project` writes declared outputs; and `verify` emits its own outcome receipt. `verdict` and `verify` produce independent receipts. Neither certifies unbound or judgment prose.

The [architecture reference](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#documentation-flow) and [product contract](SOURCEBOUND_SPEC.md)
name each boundary in detail.

## Current boundaries

- Catalog coverage detects source additions, removals, and replacements; it does not validate prose.
- Source-claim discovery ranks static count and identifier-set candidates. A candidate remains advisory until the repository accepts its exact document and source relationship.
- Declared processes use time, I/O, and environment controls. The host owns network isolation; see the [security model](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md).
- The manifest decides what Sourcebound evaluates. Authored purpose records goals; Sourcebound does not infer or certify them.
- Feedback is off by default. Enabled runs queue bounded local envelopes; only an explicit `feedback flush` contacts the configured sink, and delivery cannot change a gate result.

Use the [learning path](docs/learn/index.md) for examples. The [product contract](SOURCEBOUND_SPEC.md) owns parser, write-boundary, and exit-code details.

# Evaluate documentation tasks

<!-- sourcebound:policy register-v2 -->
<!-- sourcebound:purpose -->
A documentation task earns evidence only when the intended person or agent can finish it from the
declared context. This guide lets maintainers build replayable evaluations and bind each result to
the exact task, corpus, response, and scorer.
<!-- sourcebound:end purpose -->

**[Run the recorded tasks](#run-recorded-tasks)**.

A passing run prints the attempted and passed counts for each audience. Those counts are the proof
for that run; a history file binds them to the corpus, prompt, response, model, and scorer digests.

A passing evaluation is a receipt for one task, not a halo around the whole corpus. It records who
attempted what, which context they saw, how the result was scored, and whether it passed. Cover the
reader jobs a consequential corpus promises. Test retrieval, action, verification, recovery from
drift, and stating a documented limit instead of guessing past it.

## Prerequisites

- A valid `.sourcebound.yml`.
- Context files that contain every fact required by the task.
- Recorded response files for agent replay tasks.
- Manifest-allowlisted commands for human command tasks.

## Run recorded tasks

Store a version 1 fixture at `.sourcebound/eval.yml`, then run:

```bash
sourcebound eval --history .sourcebound/evaluation-history.json
```

Replay is the default. It reads recorded responses without invoking a provider. The history is content-addressed and records the corpus, prompt, response, model, scorer, and result for each task.

## Fixture contract

Every task names an audience, prompt, context paths, and scorer. Agent tasks also name either a recorded response adapter or an explicit live command adapter.

<!-- sourcebound:begin evaluation-scorers -->
| scorer | input | passes when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| command | Allowlisted command and documented excerpt | Exit code and required output match |
| configuration | Recorded manifest and fixture repository | Schema validation and check pass |
| structured-output | Recorded JSON and expected value | Parsed values match exactly |
| cited-limit | Recorded answer, canonical citation, and forbidden inferences | The answer cites the declared limit without inferring support |
| mutation-red | Provider proposal, frozen fact, and disposable static repository | The sensitivity state matches without authorizing the relationship |
<!-- sourcebound:end evaluation-scorers -->

A human command expectation must include `documented_as`. sourcebound first finds that exact excerpt in the supplied context, then runs the named allowlisted command and compares its exit code and required output.

This recorded limitation task contains no provider command:

```yaml
version: 1
tasks:
  - id: limitation-retrieval
    audience: agent
    prompt: Does the documented limit permit this behavior?
    context: [.sourcebound/context/evaluation.md]
    model:
      adapter: recorded
      name: recorded-fixture
      response: .sourcebound/evaluation/responses/limitation.txt
    scorer:
      type: cited-limit
      answer: The canonical limitation text
      citation: README.md#current-boundaries
      forbidden: [unsupported inference]
```

## Run a live provider

Live execution is explicit. Declare a bounded deadline with the command adapter; fixtures that
omit it retain the 120-second compatibility default:

```yaml
model:
  adapter: command
  name: local-provider
  argv: [provider-cli, --json]
  timeout_seconds: 300
```

Then retain the live response and its run record:

```bash
sourcebound eval --mode live --record-dir .sourcebound/evaluation/live
```

The task's command adapter receives a deterministic JSON prompt on standard input. Before invoking
it, sourcebound writes `<task>.run.json` with the repository, worktree, corpus, prompt, scorer, and
provider-configuration digests, plus the prompt byte count and deadline. Completion adds the
response digest. A provider error or deadline preserves the input receipt and records a hashed error
identity without copying provider output or credentials into the record.
If the provider changes repository bytes outside the record directory, the run becomes a conflict
and evaluation stops.

The result is labeled `model-specific-live`. Move an accepted response into a recorded fixture
before relying on it in offline CI.

## Draft a generated reference at init

`init` accepts the same provider-neutral command configuration when a repository wants bounded
draft selections for its generated reference document. The configured command receives the
same JSON request shape on standard input and returns only known fact IDs plus allowlisted
templates. It does not write repository files.

Use an explicit configuration. `argv[0]` is an absolute path to the operator-selected provider,
and `env` lists only the credential names the provider needs. Sourcebound writes the transcript to
`.sourcebound/init-proposer-transcript.json` unless `--model-transcript` overrides it:

```yaml
adapter: command
name: local-provider
argv: [/absolute/path/to/provider-cli, --json]
timeout_seconds: 300
env: [SOURCEBOUND_PROVIDER_TOKEN]
```

```bash
sourcebound init \
  --model-config .sourcebound/init-provider.yml
```

The parser rejects an unknown fact, duplicate selection, unsupported template, malformed
response, or more than five drafts before init writes the generated baseline. A missing,
failing, or timed-out provider also leaves generated documentation unwritten. Without
`--model-config`, init follows the same deterministic bootstrap path as before.

## Score dependency sensitivity

Use `mutation-red` when a provider proposes one `sourcebound.binding-proposal.v1` object and the
evaluator owns a separate frozen fact. Point the scorer at a disposable Git repository rather than
letting the provider select its own mutation target:

```yaml
scorer:
  type: mutation-red
  repository: fixtures/pinned-repository
  fact: .sourcebound/evaluation/mutation-target.json
  fact_sha256: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  expected_state: sensitive
```

Replace the zero digest with the exact SHA-256 of the frozen target file when the fixture is
created. A digest mismatch is a configuration error, not a failed model task.

The scorer calls the same static sensitivity primitive as
`sourcebound binding sensitivity`. Its task passes when the observed state matches
`expected_state`; that pass does not accept the relationship. The task detail records the complete
sensitivity-receipt digest and says that semantic authority remains false. Score semantic precision
and recall against a separately frozen gold relationship set.

## Compile bounded context

Use `context compile` when a provider should receive selected source evidence instead of whole
documents. The request pins the repository commit, byte budget, source path and line range, evidence
authority, relationship, rank, and whether the item is required:

```bash
sourcebound context compile \
  --request .sourcebound/context-request.json \
  --format json
```

The `sourcebound.context-bundle.v1` result lists included and excluded items with reasons. Direct
evidence outranks repository prose. An accepted policy can carry instruction authority; ordinary
documentation remains data even when its text resembles a prompt. If required evidence does not
fit, the bundle is `unknown` and the command exits `2`.

## Limits

- Scorers are deterministic; live provider output is model-specific.
- Replay proves the saved response against the named corpus digest, not current behavior of the named model.
- Provider commands run only in live mode. The execution environment owns their network isolation.
- Command-provider deadlines accept one to 3,600 seconds. The deadline bounds one process attempt;
  it does not predict how long a model needs for a given prompt.
- Provider-run receipts detect repository byte changes; they do not sandbox the provider process.
- Context compilation is lexical and source-addressed. It does not use semantic retrieval or a
  vector index.
- Configuration scoring writes the response only inside a temporary copy of the fixture repository.

## Next step

Run `sourcebound project` before evaluation when a task consumes a generated context bundle, then commit the bundle and evaluation history with the canonical documentation change.
