# DECISION_LOG: consequential choices in the doc-standard harden-and-prove pass

Each entry states the context, the options, the choice and why, and how reversible it is. This
is a changelog surface, so it carries dates and program provenance on purpose.

## 1. Define the reader-facing surface by the repo's own index, not by filename alone (2026-07-12)

Context: the corpus rule "process artifacts belong off the reader-facing surface" needs a
definition of that surface. Options: (a) treat every tracked `.md` as reader-facing and archive
anything whose name matches a process pattern; (b) treat the index that `docs/README.md` and
`LIMITS.md` build as the surface, and archive only orphaned process docs. Chose (b): the repo
already curates a Start Here / Decisive proof / Core References / Evidence archive layout and
cites specific reports as claim-evidence, so honoring that curation is more truthful than a
filename sweep, and it prevents archiving a report that `LIMITS.md` depends on. Reversible: the
kept-vs-archived split is a list in NOTES; any file can be re-archived or restored with one `git
mv`.

## 2. Archive into `docs/archive/`, conforming to the existing convention, not a new top-level `archive/` (2026-07-12)

Context: the work order suggested "an `archive/` outside the doc tree." ultra-csm already has a
populated `docs/archive/` (51 historical program reports). Options: (a) create a top-level
`archive/` as the work order literally says; (b) extend the existing `docs/archive/`. Chose (b):
a second archive home would compete with the first and violate the one-canonical-home rule the
standard teaches. Deviation from the literal instruction is deliberate and noted. Reversible:
the moves are renames; relocating the whole archive later is another `git mv`.

## 3. Archive superseded prompt versions rather than special-case them in the linter (2026-07-12)

Context: `agent1_slot_b_reason_draft_v1/v2/v3` are near-duplicates of `v4` and of each other
(~38 near-dup findings). Code loads only `v4`. Options: (a) add a linter exception for versioned
prompt files; (b) archive the superseded versions so only the canonical one remains. Chose (b):
older versions are history that git holds, and keeping one canonical version is the exact fix the
one-canonical-home rule prescribes. No linter change was needed. Reversible: `git mv` back if a
version is ever needed on the surface.

## 4. Linter tune -- exclude an `archive/` path segment from the directory scan (2026-07-12)

Context: after the moves, 196 findings sat inside `docs/archive/`, flagged as "on the
reader-facing surface." An archive is off-surface by construction. Options: (a) leave it and
justify 196 findings; (b) skip `archive/` in the scan. Chose (b): the linter's job is the reader
surface, and archived history is not it; an explicit single-file target still lints so an archived
doc can be inspected on demand. Evidence: 51 already-archived program reports were flagged before
any of my moves. Reversible: one regex, `ARCHIVE_RE`, gates it.

## 5. Linter tune -- drop `IF/THEN` from HARNESS_RE (2026-07-12)

Context: the only audience findings on genuine docs (`AGENT_PROFILE.md` x3,
`TENANT_LOOPWAY_BIBLE.md` x4) were driven entirely by `IF/THEN`. In this repo `IF/THEN` names a
decision-record format; it appears in citations ("recorded in `PROGRAM_REPORT_14`'s IF/THEN") and
as a metrics-table column, not in agent-address prose. Options: (a) keep it and justify the two
docs; (b) drop the token. Chose (b): the strong agent-address signals ("next executor", "pick up
this branch", "worktree", "STOP condition") remain, so dropping one generic-looking token removes
false positives without hiding a real agent-addressed doc. Reversible: one term in one regex.

## 6. Linter tune -- drop `byte-identical` from PROVENANCE_RE (2026-07-12)

Context: `byte-identical` flagged `LIVE_INTEGRATION_FINDINGS.md:392` ("per-arc round-trip
byte-identical after CRLF normalization") and `AGENT_PROFILE.md:17,93` (a `make`-target `PASS:`
message and meta-discussion of the phrase). Those are technical fidelity claims, not authoring
receipts. Options: (a) keep it and justify; (b) drop it. Chose (b): round-trip byte-equality is a
real content claim about data as often as it is a receipt, and the `(Program|Wave|Harvest N)`
tags plus "verified after authoring" carry the provenance-as-canon signal. Reversible: one term.

## 7. Record three gaps as judgment-only in the standard, do not fake a mechanical check (2026-07-12)

Context: three real distinctions the run exposed cannot be mechanized safely. An executed plan
vs a live plan differs by a status line, not a name (`RESEED_PLAN` "EXECUTED" vs `EVAL_PLAN`
"active"). A doc about agent operation vs a doc for a future agent differs by who the second
person is, not by vocabulary density. "Each section leads with its takeaway" has no token
signature. Options: (a) add brittle regexes; (b) record them as instruction-only in the
standard's honest seam and name where an LLM-judge pass slots in. Chose (b): a judge-by-pattern
check for a judgment call misfires in both directions, the failure mode this system was built to
avoid. Reversible: prose in `STANDARD.md` section 6.

## 8. Emit interoperable stepwise skills via an edge adapter, not an engine change (2026-07-13)

Context: an interoperable distribution target requires a stepwise skill format. Options: (a)
teach the engine that format; (b) keep one native model and project it through an edge adapter.
Chose (b). `src/clean_docs/emit/stepwise.py` reads the manifest and writes `config.yaml` plus
ordered reference steps chained by `next_step`. The package names the repository's bound docs
and carries clean-docs' audit, repair, and verify workflow, so it is a projection instead of a
static clone. Other projection formats can remain sibling adapters over the same model. The
`test_emit_stepwise` E2E proves schema shape, stable reruns, manifest grounding, navigation, and
workflow execution in a temporary repository. A target-specific build, security scan, or server
integration remains outside this proof. Reversible: the adapter is isolated under `emit/`;
deleting it leaves the engine untouched.

## 9. Add an llms.txt projection and judge emit targets by payload, not format (2026-07-13)

Context: the stepwise-skill adapter is format-correct but its payload is clean-docs' own command
workflow. context-mill is a content system, so a package that carries commands is dressed in a
content system's shape and no external registry will serve a "run clean-docs" skill. Options: (a)
treat the stepwise skill as a live integration; (b) draw a content-vs-command line, keep the
stepwise skill as a demonstration of format fluency and adapter architecture, and add the
content-carrying projection the system actually wants. Chose (b): `src/clean_docs/emit/llms_txt.py`
emits an llms.txt index of the manifest's source-bound documents, each linked with its bindings
and a content sha256, regenerated as bindings change, so the index stays current by construction.
The Agent Skill (`skill/SKILL.md`) already owns the command payload. The interface-compat doc now
states this seam and labels the stepwise skill demonstration, not live integration. Reversible:
the projection is additive under `emit/`; the framing is prose.
