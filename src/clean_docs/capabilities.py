PRODUCT_OVERVIEW = (
    "Version 0.4a1 projects one verified documentation graph into llms.txt and named context "
    "bundles, with source refs, content digests, link verification, and freshness checks. "
    "It compares normalized public surface across git refs and reports changed "
    "binding drift, coverage gaps, and SARIF annotations. It statically inventories package, "
    "CLI, API, schema, test, and documentation surfaces and bootstraps a source-bound baseline. "
    "It audits documentation without "
    "configuration and verifies region, claim, and symbol bindings from static Python, "
    "structured data, text files, path globs, and allowlisted JSON commands. It emits "
    "manifest-derived stepwise skill packages and llms.txt indexes, and it never imports "
    "repository code. `derive` previews changes "
    "unless you pass `--write`; `audit` and `check` never write."
