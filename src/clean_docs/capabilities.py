PRODUCT_OVERVIEW = (
    "Version 0.2 alpha statically inventories package, CLI, API, schema, test, and documentation "
    "surfaces. It audits documentation without configuration and verifies region, claim, and "
    "symbol bindings from static Python, structured data, text files, path globs, and "
    "allowlisted JSON commands. It emits manifest-derived stepwise skill packages and llms.txt "
    "indexes, and it never imports repository code. `derive` previews changes "
    "unless you pass `--write`; `audit` and `check` never write."
