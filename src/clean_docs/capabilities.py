"""Public capability registry rendered into the clean-docs README."""

PRODUCT_OVERVIEW = (
    "Source owns the facts; the packaged standard owns their form. clean-docs audits tracked "
    "Markdown, binds claims to source evidence, repairs declared regions, and fails CI when "
    "either the facts or the documentation contract drift.\n\n"
    "Static adapters cover Python, TypeScript, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, package metadata, and MCP "
    "tools without importing repository code. Declared commands and versioned plugins run in "
    "disposable copies with bounded I/O and minimal environments.\n\n"
    "The same verified graph produces `llms.txt`, named context bundles, grounded release facts, "
    "and task evaluations for people and agents. Local receipts make those checks inspectable "
    "without telemetry.\n\n"
    "`derive` previews changes unless you pass `--write`. `audit`, `check`, `verify`, and "
    "`release` never change documentation."
