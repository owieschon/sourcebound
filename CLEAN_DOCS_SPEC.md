# Current clean-docs product contract

<!-- clean-docs:policy register-v2 -->
<!-- clean-docs:purpose -->
Repository maintainers use this contract to decide what a green clean-docs result actually
guarantees. It separates checked evidence from catalog visibility and authored judgment, so an
operator can choose the right gate without treating a passing receipt as proof of the whole corpus.
<!-- clean-docs:end purpose -->

**[Run the current operator workflow](#operator-workflows)**.

`clean-docs verify` is the proof: its receipt names the configured assurance scope and reports
direct bindings separately from cataloged surface.

## What clean-docs is

clean-docs is a local documentation-control engine and CLI. It binds selected documentation facts
to repository evidence, checks those relationships without a model, repairs declared regions, and
projects the same canonical pages for people and agents.

The repository manifest decides which facts receive direct protection. Static inventory makes
uncovered changes visible, but clean-docs does not infer product strategy, decide which concepts
deserve explanation, or certify unbound prose.

## Assurance boundaries

The table below is part of the shipped capability registry:

<!-- clean-docs:begin assurance-boundaries -->
| surface | clean-docs proves | clean-docs does not prove |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bound region, claim, or symbol | Configured evidence and documentation still agree | Unbound prose is accurate or complete |
| Repository catalog | Detected additions, removals, and replacements stay visible | Every cataloged item needs or has a reader-facing explanation |
| Packaged writing policy | Implemented deterministic rules pass | Motivation, pedagogy, personality, or usefulness pass judgment |
| Authored purpose and scope | Declared markers and configured relationships remain intact | The repository chose the right goals, audience, or priority |
<!-- clean-docs:end assurance-boundaries -->

An outcome with `"ok": true` means the configured contract passed. Read
`outcomes.direct_coverage_complete` before claiming source-specific coverage across the detected
surface. A catalog entry is a change detector, not a prose claim.

## Operator workflows

Use `audit` before a manifest exists. It checks the active Markdown corpus, local links, purpose
contracts, implemented register rules, process residue, and the exact accepted-debt baseline.

Use `init --no-model` once to add a repository-surface binding, `llms.txt`, and purpose markers where
substantive authored prose already exists. It stops instead of replacing an existing manifest or
inventing purpose for an ambiguous page.

Use `check` for configured binding and projection drift. Use `check --changed --base REF --head REF`
to classify affected bindings and newly detected public surface. Unsupported or uncovered public
surface fails instead of becoming a no-impact claim.

Use `drive` to repair region bindings after deterministic policy checks. It does not rewrite
unbound prose. Run `project` afterward when a projection includes a repaired page, then run
`verify` for the combined audit, binding, projection, coverage, and optional changed-surface
receipt.

The [CLI reference](docs/CLI.md) owns the command index. Command-specific `--help` owns exact flags.

## Manifest contract

The canonical file is `.clean-docs.yml`, manifest version `1`. Unknown keys fail validation.

Current binding types are:

- `region`: extract typed evidence, render one marked block, and compare exact document bytes.
- `claim`: run one allowlisted JSON command and compare a typed value at an existing heading.
- `symbol`: prove that one cited path or Python symbol still exists.

Current projections are `llms.txt`, exact-byte context bundles, and the static recorded demo.
Plugins may add extractors, discoverers, renderers, and policy findings through process API version
`1`; they cannot replace first-party evidence or set coverage state.

The [manifest reference](docs/REFERENCE.md) owns accepted fields and examples. The
[extension reference](docs/EXTENSIONS.md) owns the plugin protocol.

## Evidence and execution

Static adapters parse Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, package metadata, and
configuration schemas without importing repository modules. A claim command or plugin runs only
when the manifest declares its exact argument array.

Declared processes receive a disposable repository copy, temporary directories, a minimal
environment, a timeout, an I/O limit, symlink checks, and secret-output checks. These controls are
not an operating-system sandbox. The [security model](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md) owns the complete
boundary.

## Writing policy and model boundary

The packaged policy compiles from [`STANDARD.md`](STANDARD.md). `audit` and `drive` enforce its
implemented deterministic floor. The complete standard also asks reviewers to judge why the page
matters, how it teaches, where it belongs, and whether its personality helps. A green mechanical
result does not certify those qualities.

The optional phrasing path accepts recorded provider output that selects at most five known fact
identifiers and allowlisted templates. Deterministic code renders the resulting sentences. Required
checks, CI, and release extraction do not need a model.

## Current non-goals

clean-docs does not:

- infer or authorize product goals, audience priorities, non-goals, or safety policy;
- decide that every detected symbol deserves reader documentation;
- rewrite unrelated prose after a source change;
- use model judgment as a required gate;
- provide operating-system or network isolation;
- maintain a hosted service, account system, or runtime dashboard;
- send telemetry from the CLI;
- claim that generated prose reaches the quality of a skilled human writer.

## Compatibility

The 1.x line preserves manifest version `1`, plugin API version `1`, published machine schemas, and
stable command meanings. Minor releases may add optional fields. An incompatible manifest exits
`2` before extraction, and a removed stable surface requires a major release.

Use the [install guide](docs/INSTALL.md) for package and artifact lifecycle tasks. The
[support guide](docs/SUPPORT.md) owns CI pinning, corpus adoption, receipts, and diagnostics.
